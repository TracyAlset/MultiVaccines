```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(knitr)
newdata<- read.csv(file="clinicalTrial.csv")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
newdata <- newdata %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```

###Graphical results:

```{r}
barchartGC(~ infected+vaxStatus ,data=newdata)
barchartGC(~infected+ vaxStatus,data=newdata, type="percent")

```

It seems that the people who weren't affected by covid and took the vaccines have the same percentage. Out of the people who got affected: the highest numbers wee for those who didn't take the vaccine, then comes just taking the first , after that it's just taking the new vaccine, and the best situation with the least number of people infected is taking both the first and new vaccine.
